<div class="main"> <h3>INFO...</h3>
<p>This theme is provided free of charge and <em>as is.. <br />
</em>I will offer support
if I am able to do so but I offer no guarantees. If you
wish to use this theme then you may want to test it yourself under various situations
with various browsers. I make themes only as a hobby and I am by no means an
expert so I offer no promises on them. <br />
I have tested this theme with IE6,
Netscape 7, Mozilla firebird and Opera 7... I have also made sure that this
theme and CSS shows no errors when validating as XHTML 1.0 transitional. (I
didn't do this in my other themes) I have <strong>not</strong> viewed the theme
in older browsers. If you are concerned at how your site appears in older browsers
then you should check this theme with older browsers before using it.</p>
<p>This theme does not show the right blocks!!! .. If you have right blocks showing,
they will simply be placed in the left column under the left blocks. I understand
that a lot of people like to have the option of right blocks, but I just don't
think it suits this theme. I plan to find something else to do with the right
blocks on my next theme, but I haven't figured out what yet :) </p>
<h3>To install the theme...</h3>
<ol>
<li>Upload the theme folder to the themes directory on your server. Make sure
you upload the correct folder. <span class="style1">*NOTE</span> : The correct
folder is the folder that contains the &quot;theme.html&quot; file, look
inside the folder you are uploading and make sure its the correct folder,
an extra folder may be created in the unzipping process, so CHECK!! </li>
<li>Log into your site as administrator and navigate to the <span class="style2">administration
menu &gt;&gt; system &gt;&gt; templates</span>. Use the template upload
feature to upload the tar.gz file included in the themes zip file.</li>
<li>Go to <span class="style2">administration &gt;&gt; system &gt;&gt; preferences&gt;&gt; general</span> and
set both the theme and templates as default. </li>
</ol>
<h3>If you wish to make modifications to the theme after you have uploaded it:</h3>
<p> Navigate
to <span class="style2">administration &gt;&gt; system &gt;&gt; preferences&gt;&gt; general</span> and
check &quot;yes&quot; where it says &quot;<em>Update module
template .html files from themes/your theme/templates directory?</em>&quot; ..
your updates will not show otherwise. (you should set this back to &quot;no&quot; when
you have finished making modifications to the theme) </p>
<h3>More...</h3>
<p>You can set the width of the theme to your liking. By default it is set to
80%... You may want to set it to a pixel value so that you have control over
the overall look of your site.</p>
<p><strong>To change the width of the theme to a pixel value:</strong><br />
Open the style.css file found in the theme folder (you can open it
in notepad or a css editor etc) Near the top you will see this line: </p>
<p class="dcode">.mainpage {<br />
width: 80%;<br />
}</p>
<p>you can change the &quot;80%&quot; to a pixel value ie: &quot;720px&quot; this
will give the theme a set width.</p>
<h3>PNG...</h3>
<p>The header.png file is available for download at my site or from <a href="http://www.scds.com.au/files/dravidheader.png">here</a> ..
If you have macromedia fireworks, you will be able to modify it and export
the slices. (its already sliced) .... I am not sure if the slices and layers
will show up in other app's. Macromedia fireworks will give you the option
to change the colors, buttons or add imagens etc and easily export the slices
by right clicking on them. </p>
<h3>Buttons...</h3>
<p>The buttons at the top of theme are easily modified, if you look at theme.html
in an editor at around line 72 you will see:</p>
<p class="dcode">&lt;!-- start Buttons --&gt;<br />
&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_url}&gt;/&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_imageurl}&gt;but1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Home&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;42&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; <br />
&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_url}&gt;/modules/mydownloads/&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_imageurl}&gt;but2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Downloads&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;42&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; <br />
&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_url}&gt;/modules/contact/&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_imageurl}&gt;but3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;42&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; <br />
&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_url}&gt;/search.php&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_imageurl}&gt;but4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Advanced Search&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;42&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; <br />
&lt;!-- end Buttons --&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>You can easily add more buttons by adding new lines. ie: to make a button
for your links page, make a new button, name it but5.png and add this line:</p>
<p class="dcode">&lt;td width=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_url}&gt;/modules/mylinks/&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;&lt;{$xoops_imageurl}&gt;but5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Links&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;42&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; </p>
<h3>Finish...</h3>
<p>You may do whatever you want with this theme, I just hope it helps someone
out. If you have any suggestions for me or advice etc, then please let me know. </p>
